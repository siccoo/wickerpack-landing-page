            most of our team members has a strong connection with this park. Most of us have lived in Buffalo all our

            species. However, it's very important that we protect the few that still inhibit among us. We work very hard

              us take any action to prevent our living areas to become more and more polluted, we'll just live in a
              dirty and unhealthy environment. We're also working on bringing awareness to different issues related to
              the environment, and we've seen a clear improvement(in terms of pollution in our parks) over the past
